# Quantum-Computing-Notes
Notes to keep track of my progress in Quantum Computing

Quantum Computing is incredibly hard. I don't see a way to master it unless I make a github repo, add notes to it, and periodically revise it. This github repo is an outcome of my efforts.

I am not really going to make it well-maintained. Its my own purposes only. But you can contribute I guess.
